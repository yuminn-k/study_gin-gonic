/*
To DELETE from a slice, we use APPEND along with SLICING. For this hands-on exercise, follow these steps:
  - start with this slice
  - x := []int{42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51}
  - use APPEND & SLICING to get the values here which you should then print:
  - [42, 43, 44, 48, 49, 50, 51]

	fmt.Println(x)
